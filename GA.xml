	<licensing>
		<description kind="PPL(A)">PPL(A) is a basic license that is the first step into aviation. With this license you are not allowed to earn money on your operations, however you can share costs of the flight with your passangers. By default you can fly any single engine piston with MTOW up to 5700 kg but this can be enhanced by type ratings and other additional certification.</description>
		<description kind="CPL(A)">CPL(A) allows a pilot to earn money on aviation operations, but not in a regular airline transport. You may for example charge passengers for scenic flights. To get this license you need PPL(A) license, VFR Night and MEP(L) certification as well as at least 150 hours of flying experience.</description>
		<description kind="ATPL(A)">ATPL(A) shares the practical part with CPL(A) but has a way more advanced theoretical training. This license allows you to fly as an airline pilot in regular commercial transport.</description>
